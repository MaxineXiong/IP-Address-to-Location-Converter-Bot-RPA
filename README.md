<br/>

This repository hosts an automation solution designed to address the challenge outlined in the requirements below.

### **Objective**

Build a bot which **converts IP Addresses in an Excel spreadsheet to their respective physical locations including Country, Region and City**. Use the site [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) to convert the IPs. See the attached resources of this lecture to download the "IPs.xlsx" spreadsheet.

### **Instructions**

- Navigate to the IP Lookup page on the [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) website.
- Read the data from IPs.xlsx into a DataTable variable using a workbook *Read Range* activity.
- Loop through each row using a *For Each Row* activity.
- Add a *Try Catch* activity into the body of the *For Each Row* to catch any errors that occur in the loop.
- Set the catch to a System.Exception and use a *Log Message* activity to log the exception message at the error level.
- Within the Try, use a *Navigate To* activity to navigate to the URL with the predefined IP address. Hint: Your URL will look something like this: `"https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/" + YourIPAddressExpression`
- Add a 3 second delay snippet after this activity.
- Scrape the text of the Country, Region and City and store them in String variables. Use the *Anchor Base*, *Find Element* and *Get text* activities.
- Write the results to the Spreadsheet in the relevant columns using a *Write Cell* activity.
